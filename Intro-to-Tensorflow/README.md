# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation

## Lab - Tensorflow Neural Network

First project building a simple neural network with a single layer on tensorflow.

## Getting Started

It was provided two conda environments, one for Windows  and another for OS X/Linux.

### Windows Instructions

```
conda env create -f environment_win.yml
```

This will create and environment called *dlnd-tf-lab*. You cant activate the environment with the following command:

```
activate dlnd-tf-lab
```

### OS X and Linux Instructions

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create and environment called *dlnd-tf-lab*. You cant activate the environment with the following command:

```
activate dlnd-tf-lab
```
